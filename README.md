# Alphonse

Permissionless, non-custodial wallet with everyday UX and native privacy.

## Overview

One identity, two pools:

- **Public (Checking):** Standard EVM balance tied to public address(es).
- **Private (Vault):** Shielded balance via privacy layer (Aztec for v1).

Core principles: non-custodial always, one seed / one wallet identity, local-first, encrypted at rest, user-sovereign (SRP + encrypted snapshot = complete restore).

**v1 scope:** One EVM network, ETH + up to 2 ERC-20s, shield/private-send/unshield. No swaps, bridges, ramps, dapp connectivity, or cards.

### Dependency graph

```
@alphonse/core          ← No internal dependencies. Pure crypto + types.
    ↑
@alphonse/evm           ← Depends on core (types only). Uses viem.
@alphonse/storage       ← Depends on core (types + CryptoProvider).
@alphonse/privacy       ← Depends on core (types only). No implementation yet.
    ↑
@alphonse/mobile        ← Depends on core, evm, storage. Full app.
```

All shared packages are **platform-agnostic** — no browser or mobile-specific APIs.

## Security

**Vault Store:** Holds SRP, signing authority, privacy state, recovery data. Encrypted by a Vault Key derived from SRP via HKDF. Device Unlock Keys (Argon2id) wrap the Vault Key locally. Each device has its own unlock method.

**Key separation:** Independent keys derived from SRP via domain separation (signing, encryption, sync, pairing). One-way from SRP; cannot derive each other.

**Signing:** Wallet must be unlocked + explicit user approval for every transaction. Never auto-sign. Nothing that identifies the user unlocks the wallet. Nothing that unlocks the wallet lives off-device.

**Hardware wallets:** Ledger/Trezor via official libraries — signing only, no key import/export, approval on device screen.

**Address checker:** Local-first similarity + blocklist check on every send/paste. Warning UI before confirm. Offline-capable with periodic blocklist updates.

**Duress modes (optional, off by default):** Decoy wallet (second PIN → separate pre-funded wallet, real vault stays encrypted) and forensic wipe (third PIN → immediate data destruction). All PINs authenticate with indistinguishable timing.

**Forensic cleanup:** On uninstall/wipe — delete all preferences, caches, files. Overwrite Vault Store if platform allows.

## Privacy routing

Opt-in only. Default is direct connection. When enabled, failure blocks and notifies — never silently falls back to direct.

- **Proxy (v1):** SOCKS5/HTTP toggle for RPC and sync. Covers Tor (Orbot), NymVPN, SSH tunnels.
- **Nym mixnet (future):** Built-in `@nymproject/sdk` (`mixFetch`) for RPC routing without external apps.

## Encryption & sync

**Post-quantum readiness:** All user data encryption is abstraction-based and replaceable. Current: AES-GCM or XChaCha20-Poly1305. Designed for hybrid PQ upgrade. PQC applies to data/sync only, not blockchain signing.

**State sync:** All sync is E2EE. Synced data (contacts, labels, notes, budgets, receipts, vault metadata) is ciphertext only. Sync key derived locally.

**Storage:** Fully functional without remote storage. Remote is optional, provider-agnostic, pluggable (S3, WebDAV, file export, IPFS, Filecoin). All remote data is E2EE client-side. Providers never access plaintext or derive keys. If Alphonse disappears, users recover from SRP + encrypted snapshots.

## UX rules

Default sending is Public. Private-to-private requires a private receive identifier, not a raw address. Private-to-public warns: "This transfer is public."

## Future

- **Agent Vault:** Reserved derivation path for CLI/desktop agents. Same adapter interface and key model. Domain-separated keys from SRP.
- **Tap-to-pay (v2+):** NFC payments from Public pool only. Evaluating Numo protocol (`numopay.org`). QR fallback. Opt-in, never auto-sign.

## Coding standards

- TypeScript **strict mode** — `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`, `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`.
- **`Result<T, E>` pattern** — No thrown exceptions for expected errors. All fallible operations return discriminated `{ ok: true, value: T } | { ok: false, error: E }`.
- **Branded types** — Opaque wrappers (`Address`, `TxHash`, `SRP`, `VaultKey`, etc.) to prevent accidental misuse of primitives.
- **Factory functions** — `createXxx()` pattern for all service instantiation. No classes with `new`.
- **Platform-agnostic packages** — `packages/*` must never import browser or mobile APIs. Platform adapters live in `apps/`.
- **Tests for all core logic** — Unit tests for every new feature in shared packages.

## Contributing

1. Follow the coding standards above.
2. All PRs must pass `bun run check` and `bun run test`.
3. Keep platform-specific code out of `packages/*`.
4. When in doubt, prefer the safest non-custodial design and the smallest scope.
